We will note these requirements on your Invoice for reference.&lt;\/p&gt;\r\n    &lt;p&gt;By this point, the Deposit should be paid, otherwise the project will not move forward.&lt;\/p&gt;\r\n    &lt;p&gt;Each week we will update your invoice with new charge(s). There is generally one charge per week accounting for a lump sum of the hours per week agreed upon in step 2.&lt;\/p&gt;\r\n    &lt;p&gt;Once the project has concluded, we will add any final charges and submit your final invoice pending your payment.
