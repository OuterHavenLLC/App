## 1.3: Re:Search
### Release Notes
This release focuses on searchâ€”both inside and outside the platform, content creation, and quality of life improvements. (comming soon...)

### Re:Search
* Refined content visibility across the platform.
* Streamlined and built upon the search experience.
* Added the ability to submit and index external sites.
* TBA

### Platform Improvements
* Addressed an issue that would overrite a Member's shop data even if they were adding or editing products from other shops which they contribute to.
* A new PurgeContent() Core object efficiently and permanently purges content and its dependencies from the platform, either purging individual content from their respective SaveDelete views or bulk purging marked content via the new Purge cron job.
* Download buttons now support simultanious media downloads.
* The Share Card has been revamped with new options to share via 1:1 Chat, Group Chat, Status Updates, with recent contacts, or by copying the embed code or public link.
* Launched Free America Broadcasting, our radio station for V.I.P. Members to listen to and participate in.
* A new content creation tool (represented by a ( + ) button at the bottom-right when signed in) creates a central hub where many of the common content types may be created from.

## 1.2: Democracy
### Release Notes
A new, democratic form of content moderation is here! We are the first to establish a Congressional form of content moderation.

### Congress
* Members may now join Congress if the House has less than 100 members and the Senate has less than 50. After these thresholds are surpassed, future staff must be elected to their Congressional roles.
* Nomination to the Congressional Ballot is now possible from a Member's profile.
* Members may now vote and elect others to Congress via the Congressional Ballot.
* Each Congressional Chamber will present a searchable grid of respective Staff.
* Reported content is now put forth for a vote in the House and, if the content is voted legal, it will be put back into circulation with prejudice.
* If the House deems reported content illegal or a deadlock occures, the Senate will make a confirmation vote.
* If the Senate finds the content legal or their is a deadlock, the content will be put back into circulation with prejudice. Otherwise, it will be marked for purging from the platform and will not be searchable.
* Prejudiced content cannot be reported further, as it is henceforth considered legal.

### Polls
* Members may now create, block, share and delete Polls
* Members may search for and vote on other Member's Polls.

### Platform Improvements
* Extensions have been consolidated into a single database, and a new Extension manager has been created.
* We've streamlined the means by which most content is rendered by consolidating functionality under a new GetContentData() Core object.

## 1.1.1: Supplemental
### Release Notes
This release resolves an issue that prevented Chat messages from rendering properly, and enables recursive client-side loading of searchable lists under the new Search() function.

## 1.1: Chat
### Release Notes
This release includes fundamental changes, stability and security improvements, and many bug fixes. It is recommended that any distributed copies of the platform be updated to this release.

### Platform Improvements
* The client-side is now responsible for rendering all form inputs and content visibility filters via new RenderInputs() and RenderVisibilityFilter() objects.
* All responses are now JSON-encoded to enable further expansion and functionality on the client-side.
* We have made many improvements to the underlying client-side functionality and GUI.
* The entire server-side has been purged of any known bugs. If you find any, please let us know by going to outerhaven.nyc/feedback.
* The File System and Payment Gateway have been updated and streamlined.

### Invoices
* Shop Partners may now create and modify Invoices, or create Service pre-sets while editing an Invoice.
* Invoices are on a step-by-step basis, so Partners may set all charges at once, or add more charges as the project moves along.
* Partners may forward invoices to other members if necessary.
* Invoices may be viewed at outerhaven.nyc/invoice/{INVOICE_ID}, or via its Card while within the app.
* Bulletins are sent out to the paying Member (if one exists) when there is a new Invoice, or an update to an existing one.
* Emails are sent out when there is a new Invoice, or an update to an existing one.

### Chat
* We've revamped our Chat experience! You have the option to use the integrated 1:1 and group chats, or go to outerhaven.nyc/chat for a standalone experience.
* Articles, Blogs, Forums, and SHops now have Group Chat functionality should the author enable it.
* Members may now create, update, and purge Group Chats.
* Paid Messages are possible via Group Chats as a form of content monetization if the owner has enabled payment processing via their shop.
* Members may bookmark Group Chats, which will appear under the titular list in the Member's personalized Chat experience.
* A platform-wide list of Group Chats is also available by going to Menu > Discover > Chat. These are subject to content visibility filters.

Lots of minor adjustments and improvements are also included in this release, and we've got some game-changing functionality in the works for 1.2!
