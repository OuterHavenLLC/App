# Change Log
## 1.1: Chat
### Release Notes
This release includes fundamental changes, stability and security improvements, and many bug fixes. It is recommended that any distributed copies of the platform be updated to this release.

### Platform Improvements
* The client-side is now responsible for rendering all form inputs and content visibility filters via new RenderInputs() and RenderVisibilityFilter() objects.
* All responses are now JSON-encoded to enable further expansion and functionality on the client-side.
* We have made many improvements to the underlying client-side functionality and GUI.
* The entire server-side has been purged of any known bugs. If you find any, please let us know by going to outerhaven.nyc/feedback.
* The File System and Payment Gateway have been updated and streamlined.

### Invoices
* Shop Partners may now create and modify Invoices, or create Service pre-sets while editing an Invoice.
* Invoices are on a step-by-step basis, so Partners may set all charges at once, or add more charges as the project moves along.
* Partners may forward invoices to other members if necessary.
* Invoices may be viewed at outerhaven.nyc/invoice/{INVOICE_ID}, or via its Card while within the app.
* Bulletins are sent out to the paying Member (if one exists) when there is a new Invoice, or an update to an existing one.
* Emails are sent out when there is a new Invoice, or an update to an existing one.

### Chat
* We've revamped our Chat experience! You have the option to use the integrated 1:1 and group chats, or go to outerhaven.nyc/chat for a standalone experience.
* Articles, Blogs, Forums, and SHops now have Group Chat functionality should the author enable it.
* Members may now create, update, and purge Group Chats.
* Paid Messages are possible via Group Chats as a form of content monetization if the owner has enabled payment processing via their shop.
* Members may bookmark Group Chats, which will appear under the titular list in the Member's personalized Chat experience.
* A platform-wide list of Group Chats is also available by going to Menu > Discover > Chat. These are subject to content visibility filters.

Lots of minor adjustments and improvements are also included in this release, and we've got some game-changing functionality in the works for 1.2!
